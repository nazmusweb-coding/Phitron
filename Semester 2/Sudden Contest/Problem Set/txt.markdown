            <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Absence Due to Emergency and Assignment Submission</p>
            <br>
            <p>Respected Madam,</p>
            <p>I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend today's classes due to an unforeseen emergency. As today is the assignment submission day, I have attached the completed assignment in PDF format to this email.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I would like to explain my usual absence on Sundays and Tuesdays. Living in Kamalapur, Dhaka, I spend approximately 3-4 hours daily in traffic jams. The late starting class at 1:00 PM and the late ending class at 5:20 PM make it challenging for me to commute efficiently. If I leave at 5:30 PM after the last class, it takes almost 2 hours or more to reach home, resulting in my arrival around 7:30-8:00 PM. The crowded buses during these hours are unbearable, and the overall experience leaves me physically and mentally exhausted.</p>
            <p>Despite these challenges, I had intended to attend today's classes due to the assignment deadline. However, I received a call from my college regarding document corrections, which requires me to visit Puran Dhaka (Kadamtali, Postogola) â€“ an area opposite to my university.</p>
            <p>I apologize for any inconvenience caused and appreciate your understanding. If there are any additional steps I need to take regarding the missed classes or assignment submission, please let me know.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
            <p>Best regards,</p>
