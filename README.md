# Phitron

## Reminders: ###
1. Module 19 and 19.5 Practices are not solved yet, I will solve them after my semester final exam.
2. Some notes(doc) files aren't present in their module folder, because i didn't get anything important to note.
3. Some Class practiced codes(shown in module videos) are also missing. I have written important codes only from classes. For every single written code, visit their [github repo](https://github.com/phitronio/Batch-5-Introduction-to-C-Programming/tree/main).
